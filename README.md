# PhoneTool
PhoneTool is a swiss-army knife type application for testing/playing with various legacy phone based protocols. This is mainly meant for telephone enthusiasts who want to explore different protocols used in the good old days.

This is a side project of mine just because I like phones and had some free time. Right now this is mainly here to backup my work, and it is not is a usable state yet.

## Supported Protocols
* TTY / TDD (Under Development)
  * V.18 Standard Protocols
    * Baudot @ 45.45 baud (U.S. TTYs)
    * Baudot @ 50 baud (used in England, Australia, and some other countries; also known as “international” Baudot)
    * V.21/text telephone version (used in Sweden, Norway, and Finland).
    * DTMF (used in Denmark, Holland, and some other countries)
    * EDT (“European Deaf Telephone,” used in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and several other countries)

## Project Goals
Ultimately this project is for my own learning about the telephone network. I am going to add protocols that I decide to play around with as I am playing with them. I cannot find any modern software that allows these protocols to be used through a VoIP based "virtual modem", and so that is what I am trying to do here.
